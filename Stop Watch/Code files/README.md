# SysTick Stopwatch with LCD Display

A simple Stopwatch project using the SysTick timer and displaying the time on an LCD.

## About

This project implements a Stopwatch using the SysTick timer on a Tiva C microcontroller and displays the time in seconds, minutes, and hours on an LCD screen. It's a great educational project for learning about timers, interrupts, and LCD interfacing.

## Components

To build this Stopwatch project, you will need the following components:

- Tiva C Series TM4C123G microcontroller (or any similar microcontroller)
- 16x2 LCD Display
- Two push buttons (for start/stop and reset functions)
- Breadboard and jumper wires

## How It Works

The Stopwatch project uses the SysTick timer as a timebase. It starts the timer when the "Start" button is pressed and stops it when the "Stop" button is pressed. The "Reset" button resets the timer to zero. The time is displayed on the 16x2 LCD screen in the format "HH:MM:SS."

The SysTick timer generates an interrupt every second, which is used to update the time on the LCD.
