## Description
This project is a complex calculator implemented on a Tiva C Series microcontroller. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, with support for parentheses. The calculator takes input from a keypad and displays the result on an LCD screen.

## Features
- Arithmetic operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Support for parentheses to specify the order of operations.
- Real-time input processing and display on an LCD screen.
- Error handling for division by zero.

## Hardware Requirements
- Tiva C Series microcontroller (or compatible board).
- Keypad for input.
- LCD display for output.
- Required connections (provide details on wiring).

## Software Requirements
- Code Composer Studio or other compatible IDE for Tiva C Series development.
- TivaWare C Series library (or equivalent) for GPIO and peripheral control.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Code Composer Studio.
3. Build and flash the code to your Tiva C Series microcontroller.

## Usage
1. Connect the keypad and LCD to the Tiva C Series board following the hardware requirements.
2. Power on the board.
3. Use the keypad to input an arithmetic expression.
4. Press '=' to calculate and display the result on the LCD.
5. Use parentheses to specify the order of operations, e.g., `(3 + 2) * 4`.

## Documentation
Detailed code documentation can be found in the source code files. The `README.md` provides an overview of the project.
